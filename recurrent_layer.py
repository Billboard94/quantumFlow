# Recurrent Layers: A recurrent layer handles temporal dependencies between consecutive time steps in the simulation. This allows the model to capture changes in the system over time.

from tensorflow import keras

# Define a simple recurrent layer with 64 units
rnn_layer = keras.layers.SimpleRNN(units=64)
