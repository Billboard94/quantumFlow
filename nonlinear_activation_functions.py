# Nonlinear Activation Functions: Nonlinear activation functions introduce nonlinearity to the model, allowing it to learn complex patterns and relationships between input features and output values.

from tensorflow import keras

# Define a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function
activation = keras.layers.Activation('relu')
