Dense Layers: A dense layer connects all nodes of adjacent layers through weighted connections. It can be used to transform the extracted features into high-level representations suitable for predicting the final output.

from tensorflow import keras

# Define a dense layer with 64 units
dense_layer = keras.layers.Dense(units=64)
