# Batch Normalization: Batch normalization standardizes the inputs of a layer to improve stability and speed up training. It scales the inputs to have zero mean and unit variance.

from tensorflow import keras

# Define a batch normalization layer
batchnorm_layer = keras.layers.BatchNormalization()
